# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based Algorithm Visualizer built to demonstrate the step-by-step execution of core sorting and searching algorithms.  
This project helps in understanding how algorithms work internally by visualizing comparisons, swaps, and searches in real time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Visualizes sorting and searching algorithms step by step
- Adjustable execution speed
- Random array generation
- Displays values at the bottom of each bar
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Helps analyze algorithm behavior and complexity

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort — O(n²)
- Selection Sort — O(n²)
- Insertion Sort — O(n²)

### Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search — O(n)
- Binary Search — O(log n) *(requires sorted array)*
